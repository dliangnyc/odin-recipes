        <h3>What is Fried Rice</h3>
            <p>Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice, vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple to put together with whatever is in your fridge.</p>
        <h3>How to Make Fried Rice</h3>
            <p>Making fried rice is a breeze with the recipe you'll find below. The process is simple — preheat your pan before swirling in oil and aromatics, then add uncooked proteins if applicable. Add in rice and vegetables, vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.</p>
        <h3>Best Methods for Cooking Fried Rice</h3>
            <h5>Wok</h5>
                <p>This ancient cooking vessel is the most commonly used (and convenient) method for cooking fried rice. The large, high-walled pan allows for rice and other components to be tossed and combined with seasonings at high heat. Preheat your wok until a bead of water evaporates after contact, then add oil and coat the surface by swirling.</p>
            <h5>Standard Pan</h5>
                <p>A basic frying pan or skillet can also produce tasty fried rice in a pinch. Approach this method the same way you would a wok — high heat is key. Use the largest pan at your disposal to prevent food from flying out of the pan during the stir-fry process.</p>
            <h5>Griddle</h5>
                <p>Using a griddle to make fried rice is an ingenious way to cook different elements all at the same time. Start by sauteing the vegetables and aromatics, then add cooked rice and eggs to another part of the griddle's surface for a quick and satisfying meal.</p>
            <h5>Instant Pot</h5>
                <p>Day-old rice is transformed into a deeply savory delight in a pressure cooker. Use the Instant Pot's saute mode to get the garlic to a golden-brown color, then stir in rice, veggies, and eggs. Mix well and serve piping hot.</p>
